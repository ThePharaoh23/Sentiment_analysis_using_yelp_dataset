# 🎯 Sentiment Analysis Using Yelp Dataset

## 📝 Overview
A sophisticated sentiment analysis project that leverages PySpark to analyze millions of Yelp reviews. This project employs multiple machine learning models to classify customer sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights into customer experiences.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Multi-Model Analysis**: Implements three different machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
- **Large-Scale Processing**: Utilizes PySpark for efficient processing of big data
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic dashboards for result analysis
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves >85% accuracy in sentiment classification
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle millions of reviews efficiently

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **PySpark**: For big data processing and ML implementations
- **scikit-learn**: For additional ML utilities
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Java 8 or higher (for PySpark)
- 8GB+ RAM recommended
- Sufficient storage space for the Yelp dataset

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment_analysis_project.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd sentiment_analysis_project

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Dataset Setup
1. Download the Yelp dataset from [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)
2. Place `yelp_academic_dataset_review.json` in the project root directory

### 3. Running the Analysis
```bash
# Run the main analysis
python "Sentiment Analysis.py"

# Launch the results dashboard
python results_dashboard.py
```

## 📊 Results and Performance
- **Accuracy**: 87% average across all models
- **Processing Speed**: ~1000 reviews/second
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for 8GB RAM systems

### Model Performance Comparison
| Model | Accuracy | Processing Time | Memory Usage |
|-------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression | 86% | Fast | Low |
| Naive Bayes | 84% | Very Fast | Very Low |
| Random Forest | 89% | Moderate | Moderate |

## 📈 Visualizations
The `results_dashboard.py` provides interactive visualizations including:
- Sentiment distribution across different business categories
- Confidence scores for predictions
- Model performance comparisons
- Error analysis
